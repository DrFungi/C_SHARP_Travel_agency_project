# Tralvel Agency Management System

This is a project made for the C# course in Bois de Boulogne.
The main purpose of the project is to build a Winforms app, construct the class structure and its code so a travel agent can insert passengers and reservations, and perform different searches with that data.
The second objective is to learn to connect a MySql database to our project and to do CRUD adctions as well ass select actions.
